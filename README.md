->How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    I would prefer to interpret user needs by speaking to as many end-users as possible. Hearing from potential users will help in crafting user stories. Creating user stories helps because it turns requirements into an easy to understand "Who, What, Why" statement. User stories make it easier to break end-goal requirements implementable features.

->How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    I approach developing a program in my current work in a very traditional method. Since my projects at this point are still mostly quite small, it is feasible to plan them out from the beginning. Also, being university assignments, the requirements are very unlikely to change. In my future work I hope to incorporate several agile principles. Particularly, I like the idea of utilizing some form of daily scrum in any future group assignments I may encounter. Additionally for larger assignments I think agile could help me meet deadlines by breaking the allotted time into sprints.

->What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Being a good team member in a software development setting requires being present and prepared for all meetings and events. Its also important to ask for help and offer help when you can. Lastly open and frequent communication is essential to being a good team member.
